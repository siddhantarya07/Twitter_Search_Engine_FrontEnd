# GiveAwayUI
**Project Description**</br>
Nowadays, with the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies and NFTs, giveaways are targeted more towards cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin(BTC), Ethereum(ETH), and NFTs. These giveaways stand out the most because currently crypto and NFTs are buzzwords. 
Twitter is used by a lot of celebrities and influencers. These giveaway tweets go viral, sometimes the tweets bring a lot of attention from the followers. But if you think from a normal user perspective, how many influencer accounts can one person follow? And also, these giveaways happen so frequently, itâ€™s hard to keep track of them.
